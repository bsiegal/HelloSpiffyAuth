<!-- This is the template file for the main application page.  The first 
     step here is to add some elements with special IDs we'll bind to later.
     Each on of these elements will get a dynamic control added to it in
     src/main/java/org.spiffyui.hellospiffyauth/client/Index.java.

        This is a <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org">Spiffy UI</a> application built just for you and running on your computer.  This simple example shows you an easy form which makes a <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/#b=rest">REST</a> call to your server. You can edit it, build it, run it, share it with your friends, and build a product on top of it.  The application is all yours.

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    
    <p>
        You've played with the project a little, now make some changes.  
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Change this page</b> - This page is a template with most of the code in HTML and the dynamic controls added later.  Change the content in <code>src/main/java/org/spiffyui/hellospiffyauth/client/MainPanel.html</code>.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Change the style</b> - You can set any style in <code>src/main/java/org/spiffyui/hellospiffyauth/public/HelloSpiffyAuth.css</code>.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Add a <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/#b=rest">REST Bean</a></b> - Make this REST call reusable by adding it to a <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/#b=rest">REST Bean</a>.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Add a <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/javadoc/org/spiffyui/client/nav/package-summary.html">navigation bar</a></b> - Easy navigation for your application is one of the great features of Spiffy UI.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        After you make any change you can stop the server and run the <code>Ant</code> command to recompile your project.  You can also use the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE to run this application in <a href="http://www.spiffyui.org/#b=hostedMode">GWT dev mode</a>.
